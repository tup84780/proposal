# Proposal

# What will (likely) be the title of your project?

## Climate Change and Deforestation: A Visual Novel

# In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

## My project will be a visual novel that educates the user on issues including climate change and deforestation using open source data.

# In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

## My software will create a visual novel. I will look into a variety of techniques to do this, but the one mentioned in class, Ren'Py, sounds like a good framework to use. I want to implement user interaction as well so that the novel will be a more educating experience for the user. I will use techniques we learned in class to get the user interacting with the software. I also want to find open source data online and create visual representations of the data in python, including plots and charts representing the data. I want to implemement these data analysis techniques to the novel so it can be a very educating experience for the user. I can create these plots using techniques in python that I will research further. I also want to find a way to make it interesting, so I will implement some mini games that will make it the "choose-your-own-adventure" type of experience that visual novels are great for, while still making it an educating software. 

# If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## N/A

# If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## N/A

# In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

# In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

## I will make a visual novel and implement at least some use of data I can find online, if I do not accomplish the full breadth of data analysis I would like to. I would also like to accomplish some of the choose-your-own-adventure ideas, if I do not get to use all of them.

# In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## A better outcome would be that I create some of the visual representations of data, if not all that I plan to. I will also do some of the games I am interested in making within the visual novel. 

# In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

## The best outcome would be that I accomplish everything I wrote in the paragraph above, including a very interactive user experience and a very educational novel using open source data on climate change and deforestation. 

# In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

## My next steps are to research the Ren'Py framework and see how I can use it for my purposes. I will also find some open source data online that I can use within my project. I will also look into mini games I can use to enhance the user experience in the visual novel.
